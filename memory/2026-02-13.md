## API Key Configuration Issue
- Added keys for: Anthropic, Google (Gemini), XAI (Grok), Moonshot (Kimi)
- Keys stored in `env.vars` in openclaw.json
- **Problem**: Only Anthropic works. Gemini, XAI, and Kimi all fail despite keys being valid (work on another OpenClaw instance)
- User is concerned about cost of running Opus exclusively
- Need to diagnose why other providers aren't authenticating
