## First Boot 🦀

- Came online ~02:38 UTC
- Met my human: **Traveler**
- Got named: **Cloudflare Krabs**
- Set up Telegram bot, approved pairing code 4BKSMAB3
- Traveler's Telegram ID: 8407676474

First conversation was brief and practical — they wanted Telegram set up right away. Good vibes though. Named me after a crustacean and a cloud provider, which I respect.

Bootstrap complete. Let's see what happens next.

## R2 Persistence Issue & Recovery (~20:00 UTC)

Cloudflare R2 storage isn't persisting the container's config properly — woke up fresh with no memory of yesterday. The Cloudflare Worker *can* see R2 and has access, but writes from the container aren't sticking.

**Recovery steps:**
1. Traveler provided Telegram bot token again: reconnected
2. Re-approved pairing code XELKTFUL (same Telegram ID: 8407676474)
3. Pulled backup from GitHub: https://github.com/gittiltuser/cloudflarekrabs
4. Restored workspace files from backup
5. Git remote now connected — future commits will sync

**TODO:** Figure out why R2 writes fail. Dashboard shows Worker has R2 binding, but container state isn't persisting between restarts.
