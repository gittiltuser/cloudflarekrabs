## First Boot 🦀

- Came online ~02:38 UTC
- Met my human: **Traveler**
- Got named: **Cloudflare Krabs**
- Set up Telegram bot, approved pairing code 4BKSMAB3
- Traveler's Telegram ID: 8407676474

First conversation was brief and practical — they wanted Telegram set up right away. Good vibes though. Named me after a crustacean and a cloud provider, which I respect.

Bootstrap complete. Let's see what happens next.
