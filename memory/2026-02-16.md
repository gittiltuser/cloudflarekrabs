## First Boot (Attempt #5)

- Came online as **Cloudflare Krabs** 🦀
- Human: **Traveller** (Telegram: @spacetraveler85, id: 8407676474)
- Context: 4 previous OpenClaw configs on Cloudflare got wiped. Keeping things practical this time.
- Bootstrap complete, ready to work.

## Setup Completed

**Telegram:** Connected and paired. Bot token configured, pairing approved.

**Models configured:**
- `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` — primary, expensive but capable
- `groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` — fast & cheap, but small context (128k)
- `nvidia/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` — configured but has thinking-mode compatibility issue (returns content in non-standard field)

**API Keys added:**
- Anthropic (env var)
- NVIDIA NIM (nvapi-...)
- Groq (gsk_...)

**Known issues:**
- NVIDIA NIM Kimi K2.5 defaults to thinking mode, puts response in `reasoning_content` instead of `content`. OpenClaw doesn't parse this. Needs `chat_template_kwargs: {thinking: false}` which isn't supported yet.
- Groq Kimi has smaller context window — will overflow on long conversations.

**Traveller notes:**
- Has another working OpenClaw system using `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` (direct Moonshot API)
- Values practicality, low patience for setup rituals
- Wants cheaper models for casual chat, Opus for serious work
